  <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>
  <p class="answers">I think version control is benefitial for three main reasons. It allows multiple individuals to work on a file at the same time and later update that file by merging all of the changes to one master version of the file. Version control serves as a hisorical record of the file because it stores a version of the file everytime a change is made. It is because of this that we are able to restore previous versions of a file if needed. This is good because you can never really mess up a file and even if you do you can always go back to a previous version, restore it and continue working. Finally, version control is benefitial because when you save a change to a file you have to include a description of what the change was. This allows people working on the file days, weeks and even years from now a chance to understand the rational behind an integration.</p>

  <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes? </h4>
  <p class="answers">Git helps keep track of changes because it is a version control system. Therefore it has all of the benefits mentioned above. Git allows users (one or many) to work seamlessly on a file at the same time. Git is really helpful in keeping track of changes because it is a complete record of all of the changes made to a file. You can look back at a file from its inception and see what was changed, who made the change and get an idea of why that change was made.</p>

  <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
  <p class="answers">I have explained the benefits of git as a version control system above. If you are using git as your version control system you should use GitHub to store code because they work together. GitHub is a remote location that allows you to upload and store everything in one place online. GitHub also forsters collaboration because it allows your files to be accessed by many users. You can post your project on GitHub and by making it public other people can create and submit changes to be incorporated into the master document.</p>
