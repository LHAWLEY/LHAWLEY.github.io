    <h2>What is recursion?</h2>
  <p>Recursion is the idea that a function or method can call itself, passing in a different argument each time until it reaches a certain threshold.  Recursion is often used to replace loops in a method. </p>
  <p>Recursion breaks down a problem into smaller pieces.  In computer science this algorithm is known as divide and conquer.</p>
  <p>When using recusion it is important to add a base case that tells your method when to terminate.
