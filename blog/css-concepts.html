    <p>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?
Margins are outside of the boarder and allow you to control the space between the boarders of boxes that are next to one another.

Boarders separate the edge of one box from another.

Padding is the space between the boarder of a box and any content that is in a box.  By adding padding you can increase readability.

So padding goes around content, inside of a boarder, inside of margins.
