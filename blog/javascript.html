    <h2>Looping in Ruby</h2>
  <p>There is really two common types of loops in Ruby; the while and until loops</p>
  <p>A while loop tells a block of code to run while a condition is true.  When that condition is false the code will automatically stop running.</p>
  <p>A until loop will run similarly to a while loop except the opposite logic applies.  This code will run while the condition is false.  When that condition is true the code will automatically stop running.</p>

    <h2>Looping in JavaScript</h2>
  <p>There are three common types of loops in JavaScript; the for, while, do while loops</p>
  <p>A for loop will run a a block of code a specific amount of times.  This is the most common type of loop used in JavaScript.  With a for loop a counter is genrally created to show how many times a loop should run.</p>
  <p>A while loop can be used when you do not know specifically how many times you would like a loop to run.  With a while loop the condition can be something other than a counter and the loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true.</p>
  <p>A do while loop will always run a statement that is inside of curly braces at least once whether the condition is true or false.</p>
    <h2>Similarities</h2>
    <p>In both languages a loop checks a condition to see if it is true or false. If it is true the program will run a block of code.  It will continue to run a block of code until the condition returns false.  You can also break out of a loop by manually terminating it with a "break".  This tells the program to go to the next line of code.  It is possible to create infinate loops in both languages, but that should be avoided. </p>
