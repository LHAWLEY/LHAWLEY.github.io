  <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4>December 7, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Arrays and hashes are differnt two different data structures in Ruby.
    Arrays are structured in a list between [ ].
    </p>
    <p>They can contain numbers [1,2,3,4];
    strings ["this", "is", "an, "array"]; other arrays [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] ;and they can also be empty [ ].
    </p>
    <p>Each array slot has an index number starting a [0] so that you easily referance a specific object in an array.
    An example is: favorite_number [12, 6, 99, 24]
    If I wanted to retrieve 6 I would say:
    my_pets[1]
    </p>

    <p> A hash is like an array execept insead of having values that are associated with an index.  Hashes have key value pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here is an example of a hash
      my_pets = {
      my_dog: "Sophia"
      my_cat: "Fluffy"
      my_bird: "Tweets"
    }
    </p>
    <p>
    Like an array you can retrieve the values of a hash.  If I wanted to retrieve my dog I would say (my_dog) to return the value that is associated with that key which would be "Sophia"
