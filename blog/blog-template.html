How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it a little challenging, becuase we were both using diffent syntax when trying to explain what we wanted to do.  One of us would be talking in HTML5 and the other in HTML4, granted they both will get the job done, but having different commands did make it a little challenging to figure out which command was the better choice. I also ended up redoing my wireframe after I finished pairing because it did not end up really matching the flow of my website layout. I did think it was helpful doing these tasks together because I was able to talk through the pros and cons of different layouts.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I think wireframing is going to be something that I use all of the time.  I did not think I would like it, but now I see the value in putting in a little time planning before trying to code.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

A good wireframe is one that is simple and clearly lables the different content sections of the website. A good wireframe also is one that allows you to see how the website is balanced by making sure that content is evenly distributed on the page.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned "aside", although we could not get it to work.  I understand what it does and I am excited to make it work becuase it is going to need to be used on multiple pages of my site.
