  <h1>DBC Week 6</h1>
  <h2>What is in a Class?</h2>
  <h4>December 20, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Some definitions to keep in mind as we move through this blog post:</p>

      <p>Class:  A class is an object much like everything in Ruby.   However, a class has the ability to create new objects or instances of the class object.</p>

      Example Class:
        <pre><code>
          class Boat

          end
        </code></pre>

      <p>Instance Variable:  An instance variable is a variable that is defined in a class.  An instance variable starts with an @ symbol.  Instance variables can be used to share information between in methods within a specific class.  This is different from a local variable which is a variable that is housed inside of a method and can only be used in that method.</p>

      Example Instance Variable:
        <pre><code>
          @color
        </code></pre>

      <p>Instance Method:  An instance method is a method that is created within a class.  Instance methods can be used on instances of a  class only.</p>

      Example Instance Method:

      <code><pre>
      def horn
        return  "toot, toot"
      end
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>Why do we create a class?</p>
      <p>You want to create a class when you want methods to work on specific objects.  By creating a class you can add specific methods to that class and those methods can be used on only those class objects.</p>

    <p>What goes into a class?</p>
      <p>Classes contain instance variables, instance methods and class variables.</p>

    <p>Example of a Boat class

      <pre><code>
      class Boat

      attr_accessor :color, :length, :sails

        def initialize(color, length, sails)
          @color = color
          @length = length
          @sails = sails
        end

        def sailboat
          return 'My boat is #{@color}, #{@length} feet with #{@sails} sail(s)'
        end

        def horn
          return "toot, toot"
        end
      end

      boat = Boat.new('white', 50, 2)
      p boat.sailboat => 'My boat is white, 50 feet with 2 sail(s)'
      p boat.horn  => 'toot, toot'
    </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>Within the Boat class we can give our boat a color a length and a number of sails we can also give our boat a horn.
