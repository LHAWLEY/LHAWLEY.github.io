      <p>I was born in Johnson City, NY.  I lived in Montrose, PA for a large part of my life (good luck finding it on a map).  I have also lived in Rochester, NY and Gurnee, IL.  Currently home is Chicago, but that is subject to change after my completion of Dev BootCamp.</p>

      <p>I attended DePaul University in Chicago where I received a Bachelors in Liberal Arts & Sciences as well as Bachelors Communications with a focus on Public Relations and Advertising.</p>

      <p>My interest include running see my quirk below for an explanation.   I also love to travel.  When I was in college I studied abroad for six months in Barcelona, Spain.  While I was there I visited Italy, France, Greece, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and the UK.  My favorite was Capri, Italy.  If you have never been I highly recommend it.  I also have a deep love for food I am not sure if it is because I am always hungry from all the running I do or if it is because I live in a city in which I am surrounded by some of the best food in the world, but I am pretty much always eating.<p/>

      <p>Something quirky about me is that I have run ten marathons, three of which I ran in the last three months.  I will also be running one more before we enter DBC full time in January.</p>
