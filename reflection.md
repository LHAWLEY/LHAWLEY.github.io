1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that distinguishing between the three is harder than I though.  It is easy to open a book and read about the differnces, but until you actually mess around with all three it is hard to visualize exactly what the affects are. A trick that I used that made it was easier for me to visualize the layout was making the elements different colors so that I could see how my changes to the padding, borders or margins afftected the layout overall.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that it is kind of hard to get things to lay out the way that you want them to.  I tried to use a couple of the different positioning properties, but when I used them I found that as I zoomed in and out on the page that the elements moved out of their position.  So I removed some of the absolute position that I had.

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I thought getting the layout set was really difficult so I tried to focus on that instead of the more cosmetic design elements.  I know that I need to go back and pick out fonts an colors still, but I think that part is easier to impliment later after the layout is finalized.  I also need to add links to my social media accounts, but I thought that it was more important to get a handle on the layout and practice timeboxing on this exercise.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that it is hard and that it is easy to get sucked into adding CSS to a file.  I tried to limit myself to 4 hours like the challenge suggests, but I could have put in 40 hours trying to get everything the way that I want it.  I am trying to understand that this is a work in progress project.
